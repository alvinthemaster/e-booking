# Failed Booking Status Implementation

## Overview
Added support for **"failed" booking status** to properly track and display bookings that fail for reasons beyond payment issues (e.g., system errors, timeout, validation failures, etc.).

## Problem Statement
Previously, the `BookingStatus` enum did not have a "failed" state. This meant that bookings that failed due to non-payment reasons couldn't be properly tracked or displayed with appropriate visual indicators.

## Solution
Added `failed` status to the `BookingStatus` enum and implemented complete UI support in the booking history screen.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Update (`lib/models/booking_models.dart`)

#### Before:
```dart
enum BookingStatus { 
  pending,
  confirmed, 
  onboard,
  completed, 
  cancelled,
  cancelledByAdmin
}
```

#### After:
```dart
enum BookingStatus { 
  pending,
  confirmed, 
  onboard,
  completed, 
  cancelled,
  cancelledByAdmin,
  failed      // NEW - for failed bookings
}
```

### 2. UI Implementation (`lib/screens/booking_history_screen.dart`)

Added complete visual support for failed bookings:

#### Color Scheme:
```dart
case BookingStatus.failed:
  return const Color(0xFFE91E63); // Pink/Magenta
```

**Why Pink/Magenta?**
- Distinct from red (used for admin cancellations)
- Indicates error/failure visually
- Stands out for user attention
- Different from orange (pending) and gray (cancelled)

#### Icon:
```dart
case BookingStatus.failed:
  return Icons.error_outline;
```

**Why `error_outline`?**
- Clearly indicates an error state
- Outlined style consistent with other status icons
- Universally recognized symbol for failures

#### Text Label:
```dart
case BookingStatus.failed:
  return 'Failed';
```

Simple and clear to users.

## Complete Status Comparison

### All Booking Statuses:

| Status | Color | Hex | Icon | Use Case |
|--------|-------|-----|------|----------|
| **Pending** | Orange | `#FF9800` | `hourglass_empty` | Awaiting confirmation |
| **Confirmed** | Blue | `#2196F3` | `verified` | Booking confirmed |
| **On Board** | Cyan | `#00BCD4` | `directions_bus` | Passenger on van |
| **Completed** | Green | `#4CAF50` | `check_circle_outline` | Journey finished |
| **Cancelled** | Gray | `#757575` | `cancel` | User cancelled |
| **Cancelled by Admin** | Red | `#F44336` | `block` | Admin cancelled |
| **Failed** | Pink/Magenta | `#E91E63` | `error_outline` | Booking failed ⭐ NEW |

### Payment vs Booking Status

#### Payment Status (Separate):
- `pending` - Payment not completed
- `paid` - Payment successful
- `failed` - Payment transaction failed
- `refunded` - Payment refunded

#### Booking Status (Now Includes Failed):
- `pending` - Booking awaiting confirmation
- `confirmed` - Booking confirmed by system/admin
- `onboard` - Passenger has boarded
- `completed` - Trip completed successfully
- `cancelled` - User cancelled booking
- `cancelledByAdmin` - Admin cancelled booking
- `failed` - Booking process failed ⭐ NEW

## Use Cases for Failed Booking Status

### When to Use `BookingStatus.failed`:

1. **Payment Timeout**
   - User initiated booking but payment session expired
   - Set bookingStatus = `failed`, paymentStatus = `failed`

2. **System Validation Errors**
   - Invalid passenger data detected after booking
   - Seat already taken by another booking (race condition)
   - Set bookingStatus = `failed`

3. **API Failures**
   - External service (payment gateway, SMS, email) failed
   - Unable to generate QR code or e-ticket
   - Set bookingStatus = `failed`

4. **Van Capacity Issues**
   - Van became full before booking could be confirmed
   - Overbooking detected
   - Set bookingStatus = `failed`

5. **User Eligibility Issues**
   - User account suspended during booking
   - Discount eligibility changed mid-booking
   - Set bookingStatus = `failed`

## Visual Display Examples

### Scenario 1: Failed Payment
```
Booking Card Header:
Payment Status: [⚠️ Failed] (Red)
Booking Status: [⚠ Failed] (Pink/Magenta)

User sees: "Both payment and booking failed"
```

### Scenario 2: Failed Booking (Payment Pending)
```
Booking Card Header:
Payment Status: [⏰ Pending Payment] (Orange)
Booking Status: [⚠ Failed] (Pink/Magenta)

User sees: "Booking failed but payment is still pending (may need refund)"
```

### Scenario 3: Failed Booking (Payment Succeeded)
```
Booking Card Header:
Payment Status: [✓ Paid] (Green)
Booking Status: [⚠ Failed] (Pink/Magenta)

User sees: "Payment went through but booking failed (auto-refund triggered)"
Action: Admin should refund or retry booking
```

## Database Integration

### Firestore Document Example:
```json
{
  "id": "ABC123",
  "userId": "user_xyz",
  "bookingStatus": "failed",
  "paymentStatus": "failed",
  "failureReason": "Payment timeout after 15 minutes",
  "failedAt": "2025-10-20T14:30:00Z",
  "attemptedAt": "2025-10-20T14:15:00Z"
}
```

### Setting Failed Status in Code:
```dart
// When booking fails
await FirebaseFirestore.instance
  .collection('bookings')
  .doc(bookingId)
  .update({
    'bookingStatus': BookingStatus.failed.name,
    'failureReason': 'Payment gateway timeout',
    'failedAt': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  });
```

## User Experience

### In Booking History:
1. Failed bookings appear with pink/magenta badge
2. Error outline icon indicates failure
3. Users can tap to see failure details
4. "View E-Ticket" button disabled for failed bookings
5. Option to "Retry Booking" or "Contact Support" can be added

### Error Handling Flow:
```
User Books Seat
       ↓
  Payment Process
       ↓
   [Something Fails]
       ↓
bookingStatus = failed
paymentStatus = failed (if payment-related)
       ↓
User Sees Failed Badge in Booking History
       ↓
User Can View Failure Reason
```

## Code Quality

### Exhaustive Switch Statements:
All switch statements properly handle the new `failed` status:

```dart
// ✅ Color Method
Color _getBookingStatusColor(BookingStatus status) {
  switch (status) {
    // ... all 7 cases including failed
  }
}

// ✅ Icon Method  
IconData _getBookingStatusIcon(BookingStatus status) {
  switch (status) {
    // ... all 7 cases including failed
  }
}

// ✅ Text Method
String _getBookingStatusText(BookingStatus status) {
  switch (status) {
    // ... all 7 cases including failed
  }
}
```

### Type Safety:
- Dart compiler ensures all status cases are handled
- No runtime errors from missing status handling
- Easy to extend in the future

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing:
✅ Create booking with failed status in Firebase  
✅ Verify pink/magenta badge appears  
✅ Verify error_outline icon displays  
✅ Verify "Failed" text shows correctly  
✅ Check that failed bookings sort properly  
✅ Ensure action buttons respond appropriately  

### Test Data Creation:
```dart
// For testing in Firebase Console
{
  "bookingStatus": "failed",
  "paymentStatus": "failed",
  "failureReason": "Test: Payment timeout",
  "failedAt": {
    "_seconds": 1729430000,
    "_nanoseconds": 0
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Retry Mechanism**
   ```dart
   if (booking.bookingStatus == BookingStatus.failed) {
     showRetryButton();
   }
   ```

2. **Failure Details Modal**
   ```dart
   void showFailureDetails(Booking booking) {
     // Display failure reason, timestamp, suggested actions
   }
   ```

3. **Auto-Refund Integration**
   ```dart
   if (booking.bookingStatus == BookingStatus.failed && 
       booking.paymentStatus == PaymentStatus.paid) {
     triggerAutoRefund(booking);
   }
   ```

4. **Analytics Tracking**
   ```dart
   logFailedBooking(
     reason: booking.failureReason,
     stage: 'payment_processing',
     userId: booking.userId,
   );
   ```

## Files Modified: 2

### 1. `lib/models/booking_models.dart`
