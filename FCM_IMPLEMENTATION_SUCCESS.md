## 🎯 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging API (5 minutes)

```

This is **NOT critical** - notifications still work! But for full functionality:

1. **Open Firebase Console**
   - https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your project

2. **Go to Project Settings → Cloud Messaging**
   - Click on "Cloud Messaging" tab
   - Find "Cloud Messaging API (V1)"
   - Click "Manage API in Google Cloud Console"

3. **Enable the API**
   - Click blue "ENABLE" button
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for activation

### Step 2: Test Full Flow (5 minutes)

#### Test Scenario: Book a Seat and Trigger Notification

1. **Create Test Booking in Firebase**:
   ```
   Firebase Console → Firestore → bookings → Add document
   
   Fields:
   - userId: "6E9SQ9yWSDN51g9vaW4Q0RB8fc93"
   - bookingStatus: "confirmed"
   - vanPlateNumber: "TEST2"  (or any van)
   - bookingDate: [current timestamp]
   - routeId: "SCLRIO5R1ckXKwz2ykxd"
   - seatNumbers: ["A1"]
   - passengerName: "Test User"
   - totalAmount: 165
   ```

2. **Fill the Van**:
   ```
   Firebase Console → Firestore → vans → TEST2
   
   Change:
   - currentOccupancy: 18  (full capacity)
   OR
   - status: "full"
   ```

3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Immediate notification appears
   - ✅ Widget shows on home screen
