# ðŸ”¥ SIMPLE INDEX FIX - Copy & Paste This!

## The Problem:
Your booking query needs a Firestore composite index, but it doesn't exist yet.

## The Solution (2 minutes):

### Step 1: Go to Firebase Console
Click this link: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/e-ticket-2e8d0/firestore/indexes

### Step 2: Click "Create Index" Button
(Top right corner of the page)

### Step 3: Fill in These EXACT Values:
```
Collection ID:     vans
Field 1:           currentRouteId     â†’  Ascending
Field 2:           status             â†’  Ascending
Query scope:       Collection
```

### Step 4: Click "Create"

### Step 5: Wait
- Status will show "Building..." (30-60 seconds)
- Wait until it shows "Enabled" with a green checkmark
- That's it!

## Test Your Booking:
1. Open your app
2. Select a route
3. Choose seats
4. Click "Proceed to Booking"
5. SUCCESS! ðŸŽ‰

## Alternative: Let Firebase Auto-Create It

1. Run your app now (without creating the index)
2. Try to make a booking
3. It will fail, but check the console output
4. You'll see an error with a clickable link
5. Click that link
6. Firebase will show "Create Index" button
7. Click it
8. Done!

**That's literally all you need to do!** The code is perfect, it just needs this one index.
