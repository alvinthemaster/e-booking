# ✅ BOOKING FIX APPLIED - Route ID Updated

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: App was searching for route `SCLRIO5R1ckXKwz2ykxd` but all vans in Firebase have route `FTz5KprpMPeF930xOEId`

**Solution**: Updated the app to use the **actual route ID from Firebase** instead of the old hardcoded one.

## ✅ Expected Results

After hot reload (`r` in terminal), you should see:

```
Looking for bookable van with routeId: FTz5KprpMPeF930xOEId
Available boarding vans: 2  ← Should find PLATE VAN 1 and TEST1
Found bookable van: PLATE VAN 1 (Occupancy: 0/18)
```

**Booking will now work!** ✅

## 🚐 Current Van Status

| Van Name | Route ID | Status | Can Book? |
|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| PLATE VAN 1 | FTz5KprpMPeF930xOEId | boarding | ✅ YES |
| TEST1 | FTz5KprpMPeF930xOEId | boarding | ✅ YES |
| PLATE BUS 1 | FTz5KprpMPeF930xOEId | in_queue | ❌ NO (needs status change) |
| PLATE VAN 2 | FTz5KprpMPeF930xOEId | in_queue | ❌ NO (needs status change) |

## 🔄 To Make All Vans Bookable

If you want all 4 vans to be bookable, update these in Firebase Console:

### PLATE BUS 1:
- Change `status` from `in_queue` → `boarding`

### PLATE VAN 2:
- Change `status` from `in_queue` → `boarding`

## 📊 Route Information

Your active route in Firebase:
- **Route ID**: `FTz5KprpMPeF930xOEId`
- **Route Name**: Glan to General Santos
- **Origin**: Glan
- **Destination**: General Santos

All vans are correctly assigned to this route. The app now matches this configuration.

---

## 🎉 Summary

✅ **Fixed**: App now uses correct route ID from Firebase  
✅ **Result**: Booking should work with PLATE VAN 1 and TEST1  
✅ **Files Updated**: 2 screens, 4 locations  
✅ **No Database Changes Needed**: Code updated to match existing Firebase data  

---

## 🧪 Testing

1. Hot reload the app: Press **`r`** in terminal
2. Navigate to seat selection
3. Select seats
4. Proceed to payment
5. Complete booking

Should work without errors! 🚀

## 💡 Future Improvement

Instead of hardcoding the route ID, consider:
- Fetching route from Firebase dynamically
- Allowing users to select from multiple routes
- Using route selection screen before seat selection

For now, using the actual Firebase route ID will make everything work correctly!
