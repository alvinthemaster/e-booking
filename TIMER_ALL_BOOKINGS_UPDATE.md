# Countdown Timer for All Booking Statuses

## Update Summary
Modified the Van Departure Countdown Widget to display the timer for **all active bookings**, not just confirmed ones.

## Problem
Previously, the countdown timer only appeared for bookings with `bookingStatus == 'confirmed'`. Users with pending bookings couldn't see when their van would depart.

## Solution
Changed the booking query to include all booking statuses except cancelled bookings.

## Code Changes

### File: `lib/widgets/van_departure_countdown_widget.dart`

#### Before:
```dart
// Listen to user's confirmed bookings
_bookingSubscription = _firestore
    .collection('bookings')
    .where('userId', isEqualTo: user.uid)
    .where('bookingStatus', isEqualTo: 'confirmed')  // ❌ Only confirmed
    .snapshots()
    .listen((snapshot) {
  debugPrint('📋 VanWidget: Received booking snapshot with ${snapshot.docs.length} confirmed bookings');
  
  if (snapshot.docs.isEmpty) {
    // No bookings found
    return;
  }

  // Get the most recent confirmed booking
  final bookings = snapshot.docs
      .map((doc) => Booking.fromDocument(doc))
      .toList()
    ..sort((a, b) => b.bookingDate.compareTo(a.bookingDate));

  final booking = bookings.first;
```

#### After:
```dart
// Listen to user's bookings (confirmed or pending)
_bookingSubscription = _firestore
    .collection('bookings')
    .where('userId', isEqualTo: user.uid)  // ✅ All statuses
    .snapshots()
    .listen((snapshot) {
  debugPrint('📋 VanWidget: Received booking snapshot with ${snapshot.docs.length} bookings');
  
  if (snapshot.docs.isEmpty) {
    // No bookings found
    return;
  }

  // Get the most recent active booking (exclude cancelled)
  final bookings = snapshot.docs
      .map((doc) => Booking.fromDocument(doc))
      .where((booking) => booking.bookingStatus != BookingStatus.cancelled)  // ✅ Filter out cancelled
      .toList()
    ..sort((a, b) => b.bookingDate.compareTo(a.bookingDate));

  if (bookings.isEmpty) {
    debugPrint('⚠️ VanWidget: No active bookings found (all cancelled)');
    // Reset widget state
    return;
  }

  final booking = bookings.first;
```

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed Status Filter in Query
**Before:** `.where('bookingStatus', isEqualTo: 'confirmed')`  
**After:** No status filter - gets all bookings

### 2. Added Client-Side Filtering
```dart
.where((booking) => booking.bookingStatus != BookingStatus.cancelled)
```
- Fetches all bookings from database
- Filters out cancelled bookings in the app
- Keeps pending, confirmed, and any other active statuses

### 3. Added Empty Check After Filtering
```dart
if (bookings.isEmpty) {
  debugPrint('⚠️ VanWidget: No active bookings found (all cancelled)');
  // Reset widget state
  return;
}
```
Handles case where user only has cancelled bookings.

## Supported Booking Statuses

### ✅ Timer Will Show For:
- **Pending** - Booking created but not yet confirmed
- **Confirmed** - Booking confirmed by admin/system
- **Any other active status** - Future statuses you might add

### ❌ Timer Will NOT Show For:
- **Cancelled** - User or admin cancelled the booking
- **No bookings** - User has no bookings at all

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: Pending Booking (NEW BEHAVIOR)
```
1. User books seats on TEST3 (status: pending)
2. Van TEST3 becomes full (18/18 capacity)
3. ✅ Countdown timer APPEARS on home screen
4. 🔔 User receives "Van is Full" notification
5. Timer counts down: 14:59... 14:58... etc.
```

**Previous Behavior:** ❌ Timer did NOT appear until booking was confirmed

### Scenario 2: Confirmed Booking (SAME AS BEFORE)
```
1. Admin confirms user's booking (status: confirmed)
2. Van becomes full
3. ✅ Countdown timer appears
4. Timer works normally
```

### Scenario 3: Cancelled Booking
```
1. User has cancelled booking (status: cancelled)
2. Van becomes full
3. ❌ Timer does NOT appear (correct behavior)
```

### Scenario 4: Multiple Bookings
```
1. User has 3 bookings: cancelled, pending, confirmed
2. Widget filters out cancelled booking
3. Widget selects most recent active booking (pending or confirmed)
4. ✅ Timer shows for that booking's van when full
```

## Console Log Examples

### Pending Booking Detected:
```
I/flutter: 📋 VanWidget: Received booking snapshot with 7 bookings
I/flutter: ✅ VanWidget: Found booking - ID: xUZllYkNVdeSQuHWxfuy, Van: TEST3, Status: BookingStatus.pending
I/flutter: 🔍 VanWidget: Listening to van with plate: TEST3
I/flutter: 🚐 VanWidget: Received van snapshot with 1 vans
I/flutter: 📊 VanWidget: Van data - Plate: TEST3, Status: "full", Occupancy: 18/18
I/flutter: 🚐 Van TEST3 detected as FULL - Occupancy: 18/18, Status: "full"
I/flutter: 🔔 VanWidget: Sent countdown start notification for van TEST3 - Time: 14:59
```

### Only Cancelled Bookings:
```
I/flutter: 📋 VanWidget: Received booking snapshot with 3 bookings
I/flutter: ⚠️ VanWidget: No active bookings found (all cancelled)
```

### No Bookings:
```
I/flutter: 📋 VanWidget: Received booking snapshot with 0 bookings
I/flutter: ⚠️ VanWidget: No bookings found for user
```

## Benefits

### 1. Better User Experience
- Users see countdown immediately after booking
- No need to wait for admin confirmation
- Real-time updates for van departure

### 2. Increased Transparency
- Users know when their van will leave even if booking is pending
- Helps users plan arrival at terminal
- Reduces anxiety about departure time

### 3. Flexible for Future Statuses
- Code works with any new booking status you add
- Only excludes cancelled bookings
- Easy to extend if needed

## Technical Notes

### Query Efficiency
**Before:** Firestore filtered on server-side (more efficient)  
**After:** Firestore returns all user bookings, app filters client-side

**Impact:** Minimal - typical user has few bookings (< 20)

### Alternative Approach (Not Used)
Could use Firestore's `whereNotEqualTo()`:
```dart
.where('bookingStatus', whereNotEqualTo: 'cancelled')
```
**Why not used:** Requires composite index, adds complexity

### Performance Considerations
- Fetches all user bookings once per login
- Real-time listener updates automatically
- Filtering 7-10 bookings is negligible overhead
- No additional database queries

## Testing Checklist
